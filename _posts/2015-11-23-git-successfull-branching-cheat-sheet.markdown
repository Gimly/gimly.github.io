Successful git branching model cheat sheet
====================================

I'm using [Vincent Driessen's "Successful Git branching model"](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as a model for my branching for most of my application.

Usually, everything goes well and I can do it without thinking much, but sometimes I forget a command or something, so I like to use a cheat sheet for those times were I get a "brainfart" and I to look things up.

I couldn't find one specifically created for the branching model, so I created one.

I've separated the sheet in how to create feature, release and master branches, each time with the information on how to create, work on and finish the branch.

[Click here](/assets/2015-11-23-git-successfull-branching-cheat-sheet/Successful_Git_Branching_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) to get the branching cheat sheet.
